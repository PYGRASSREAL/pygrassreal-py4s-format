Media type name: model

Media subtype name: vnd.pygrassreal.py4s

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters: N/A

Encoding considerations: binary
Binary container format using little endian byte ordering with fixed 128-byte header.

Security considerations: The .py4s media type defines a single-container binary asset format combining 4D Dynamic Gaussian Splatting radiance fields, temporal motion deformation fields, and synchronized deformable collision geometry. It does not contain active or executable code, scripts, or macros. Parsers should validate header magic ("PY4S"), version bounds, and section payload offsets/sizes to prevent buffer overruns or out-of-bounds memory access.

Interoperability considerations: Designed for cross-platform 4D Dynamic Gaussian Splatting and spatial computing engines including Unreal Engine 5, Unity, Web (Three.js / WebGL / WebGPU), and Python machine learning pipelines. Standardized with little-endian byte ordering.

Published specification: https://github.com/PYGRASSREAL/pygrassreal-py4s-format/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md

Applications which use this media: PyGrassReal AI 4D Platform (Kinnaree 1.0), Unreal Engine 5 via PyGrassReal 4DGS In-Engine Plugin, Unity, Three.js Web Viewers, and 4D generative AI pipelines.

Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

Restrictions on usage: None

Provisional registration? (standards tree only): No

Additional information:
1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
2. Magic number(s): ASCII "PY4S" (hex: 0x50 0x59 0x34 0x53) at byte offset 0
3. File extension(s): py4s
4. Macintosh file type code: N/A
5. Object Identifiers: N/A

General Comments: Standardized and maintained by PyGrassReal AI (https://pygrassreal.ai). Related to the established model/vnd.pygrassreal.py3s standard (IANA #1461427), extending spatial assets into 4D temporal motion and deformable real-time physics.
